Synopsis
========

``ubervisor`` *server* ``[options]``

Description
===========

Start ubervisor server.

Options
=======

-a, --autodump          create a configuration dump after each update and start
                        command.
-c, --config FILE       load a dump from FILE.
-d, --dir DIR           change to DIR after start. By default, ubervisor will
                        change to the directory ``.uber`` in the home directory
                        of the user it runs as.
-f, --foreground        don't fork into background. When running in foreground,
                        ubervisor will always log to standard output.
-h, --help              help.
-l, --loadlatest FILE   load most recent dump from the current directory. This is
                        done after changing directory (either due to a ``-d``
                        option or the default change).
-n, --noexit            don't obey the exit command.
-o, --logfile FILE      write log output to FILE. The default is ``uber.log`` in
                        the home directory of the user ubervisor runs as. The
                        log file is opened, after changing directory (either due
                        to a ``-d`` option or the default change).
-P, --perm PERM         set file access permissions on socket file (default: 600).
-s, --silent            exit silently if server is already running.

Environment
===========

Environment variables can be used to set command line switches.
Environment variables are read before command line arguments are
processed (i.e. command line overwrites environment).
