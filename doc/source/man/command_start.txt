``ubervisor`` *start* ``[options]`` *name* *command* ``[command-args]``

Description
===========

Create a new group with ``name`` for ``command``.


Options
=======

-a, --age SEC                   maximum uptime (age) of a process in this group
                                in seconds. If a process runs longer, it is
                                killed by ubervisor.
                                First ubervisor kill send a SIGTERM to the
                                process. If after 5 seconds it is still running,
                                SIGKILL is send.
                                Note that the age is evaluated with a 5 second
                                resolution.
-d, --dir DIR                   change dir to ``DIR`` before starting child.
                                The default is to not change directories.
-e, --stderr FILE               log standard error for processes in this group
                                to ``FILE``. If ``FILE`` contains the
                                substring ``%(NUM)``, the substring will be
                                replaced with the instance number assigned to a
                                process.
-f, --fatal COMMAND             ``COMMAND`` to run on fatal condition. See below.
-H, --heartbeat COMMAND         run ``COMMAND`` every 5 seconds. See below.
-g, --gid GID                   Set group id to ``GID`` for childs in this group.
                                Ubervisor may need to run as root if this option
                                is used.
-G, --groupname NAME            lookup the group id of group NAME and set the
                                group id of childs in this group to it. If
                                this option is set, the ``-g`` option is
                                ignored.
-h, --help                      display a short help.
-H, --heartbeat COMMAND         run ``COMMAND`` 5 secondly. See below.
-i, --instances COUNT           number of process to start. By default only
                                one child is started per group.
-k, --killsig SIGNAL            signal used to kill processes in this group.
                                Defaults to 15 (SIGTERM). This is used as the
                                default signal when invoking the kill command.
-o, --stdout FILE               log standard output for processes in this group
                                to ``FILE``. If ``FILE`` contains the
                                substring ``%(NUM)``, the substring will be
                                replaced with the instance number assigned to a
                                process.
-s, --status STATUS             status to create group with. By default the
                                running status (1) is used.
-u, --uid UID                   ``UID`` to start processes as. The same
                                limitations as for the ``-g`` option apply.
-U, --username NAME             lookup the user id of the user NAME. The user
                                id for processes in this group will be set to
                                it. If this option is set, the ``-u`` option is
                                ignored.


Status Codes
============

- ``1`` or ``start`` the running state. Processes are restarted, when they exit.
- ``2`` or ``stop``  means stopped. No new processes are started.
- ``3`` or ``fatal`` is the fatal, or *forced stop*, state. The ubervisor
  server sets this on process groups if too many processes exiting with an exit
  code other then ``0`` in a too short interval. No new processes are started.

Heartbeat command
=================
Binary executed every five seconds as ``heatbear-command process-group pid
instance-identifier``. Where ``process-group`` is the name of the group,
``pid`` is the process id and ``instance-identifier`` is an integer between
``0`` and ``intance-count`` (See ``-i`` option).

Fatal command
=============
Binary to be executed, if the process group enters the fatal state. It is
executed as ``fatal-command process-group``.
