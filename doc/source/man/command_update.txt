-a, --age SEC                   maximum uptime (age) of a process in this group
                                in seconds. If a process runs longer, it is
                                killed by ubervisor.
                                First ubervisor kill send a SIGTERM to the
                                process. If after 5 seconds it is still running,
                                SIGKILL is send.
                                Note that the age is evaluated with a 5 second
                                resolution.
-d, --dir DIR                   update the work directory to ``DIR``.
-e, --stderr FILE               update standard error log file for the group to
                                ``FILE``.
-f, --fatal COMMAND             ``COMMAND`` to run on fatal condition.
-H, --heartbeat COMMAND         set heartbeat command to ``COMMAND``.
-i, --instances COUNT           set number of instances to ``COUNT``. If the
                                new ``COUNT`` is larger then the old value,
                                start new instances.
-k, --killsig SIGNAL            set the default signal for the kill command to
                                ``SIGNAL``.
-o, --stdout FILE               set the standard out log file to ``FILE``.
-s, --status STATUS             set group status to ``STATUS``. As a side
                                effect, setting the status also resets the
                                internal error counter. See
