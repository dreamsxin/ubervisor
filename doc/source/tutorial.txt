Quick start

Getting Started
---------------

Start a ubervisor server by running::

   ubervisor server -f

This will run the server in foreground mode, logging to ``stdout``, so we can
see what is going on. Now switch to another terminal and instruct the server
to start something. We will use ``sleep``::

   ubervisor start group1 /bin/sleep 1

In the server terminal, you should see that the group was created and processes
starting and exiting. To instruct ubervisor it should not continue to restart
the program, run::

   ubervisor update -s 2 group1

This will set the status of the group to ``2`` (stopped). To restart it, run::

   ubervisor update -s 1 group1

Get a list of the groups maintained use::

   ubervisor list

Delete the group for the sleep command now::

   ubervisor delete group1
